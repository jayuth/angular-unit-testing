Chapter 2:
Angular Unit Testing
2 types of unit testing in Angular
-Isolated test - a single unit/class
-Intergartion test - create and test in a context of Angular module so we can test a class with its template
--shallow - test a single class 
--deep - test both parent and child components 

Automated testing
-unit testing - a single unit of code, while in development, unit = single class such as a user component
-end to end testing - test against live running app, done through manipulating and automating a browser to do things such as click a button
-integration or functional testing - in between, this part of this app works with another part of tha app suchas user component and user service

Mocking 
-since a component class usually depends on other classes such as a user component depends on the user service class to be able to function
but our focus is a unit test. we should test only a use class so we mock a user service to do whatever we want 

Types of Mocks
-dummies
-stubs
-spies
-true mocks

Tools for testing
Karma - test runner - execute our code in a broswer
Jasmine - create a mock

// keep hero that is not equal to the 'passed-in hero' parameter

if your method returns an observable, then use mock service

-duplicating code is ok in testing becuase we want to tell the story
